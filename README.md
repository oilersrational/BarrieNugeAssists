Related to a project I did where I analyze whether Tyson Barrie "stole" some assists from Ryan Nugent-Hopkins in 2020-2021. Specifically whether, for goals they were both on the ice for, Barrie recorded a disproportionally high number of assists and RNH a disproportionally low number.

I specifically encourage anyone who wants to try to scrape or find actual on-ice data (who is on the ice for each Oiler goal and who recorded the assists), and am happy to help with this endeavour.
